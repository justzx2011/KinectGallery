Kinect Gallery
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Current goal is to make a mouse driven gallery

-- Make an image gallery that cycles through a collection of images in a folder.





- the application has a PATH value that denotes the current view
- if PATH == COLLECTION_ROOT, then show the main menu
- else, show that subfolder
- may not navigate above or outside of the collection root


- Aim to do selection by mouse over timer. Show updating countdown mouse cursor.


- Create the following displays: web page, image gallery, video gallery

Transition later to Kinect driven gallery.
- When a skeleton is detected, start drawing depth/skeleton display.
- When skeleton is no-longer detected, revent to standard view.


The finishing touches ...

- motion
- voice control
- easter egg

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Image Gallery

- open a folder containing images, PDF files
- present a paged, grid view of images in the folder
- read a text file with descriptions of items; can be a CSV file with tab separated values
- display captions with images
- use keyboard control to navigate through a collection/collections
- do lazy loading of collection data
- add transitions between displays

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Video Gallery

- same as above
